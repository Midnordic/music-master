## Main Window

When you launch the application, the main window appears.

Right after startup, the **composition view** is always displayed first.

The view shown in this window depends on what is selected from the side menu.  
The side menu, located along the left edge of the window, lets you switch between different views.

## Side Menu

The side menu allows switching between the following views:
- Composition  
- Playing Tracks  
- Editor  
- Settings  
- About  
- Exit  

Selecting the last option (**Exit**) closes the application.  
If the current composition hasn’t been saved, the app will ask if you’re sure you want to exit without saving.

## Basic Functions

You can use the app as a regular music player. See how to:
- [add and remove tracks](docs/composition#adding-tracks)

- [create playlists](docs/playlists#new-list)

## Advanced Features (Editor)

But that’s not all. The application includes a multifunctional **editor**, which enables the use of events, sound effects, and automation. Learn how to:

## Cinematic Techniques for Game Masters

Music Master was created with **Game Masters** in mind — those who want to enhance their tabletop sessions with music and sound effects inspired by cinematic techniques.
