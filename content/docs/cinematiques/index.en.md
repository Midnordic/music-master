Music Master allows you to use cinematic techniques described on our **[blog](blog/)**.  
They help evoke strong emotions in players and enhance the dramatic impact of a scene.

To quickly apply a cinematic technique, simply open the **Cinematic Techniques Wizard** window.

## Cinematic Techniques Wizard {#wizard}

To open the assistant window, select **“Create Cinematiques...”** from the main menu.

An **wizard window** will appear with a list of available cinematic techniques.

To learn more about a specific technique, click the **“READ MORE”** link.  
Your browser will open the corresponding blog post describing that technique.

To choose a technique and continue, click the **“Select”** button.

## Filling in Parameters {#details}

A new window will appear where you need to fill in the required parameters.  
Each technique has a different set of parameters.

Parameters marked as **(required)** must be filled in.

To assign a track to a parameter, you can select it from the list or click the folder icon to choose a file from your disk.

Once all required parameters are set, click the **“Create”** button to add the technique to your composition.

## Using Samples {#samples}

If you just want to test how a technique works and sounds, you can use ready-made examples.

Click the **“Use samples...”** button. A context menu will appear, allowing you to choose from several predefined examples. Each technique includes at least one sample.

After selecting a sample, all parameters will be filled automatically. Simply click **“Create”** to add the technique to your composition.

## Using a Technique from Playlists {#using}

If the **“Add to active playlist”** checkbox is selected, the created technique will automatically be added to the most recently visible playlists.  

Otherwise, you will need to add it manually by dragging the newly created elements from the Composition view.

Below is an example of the **“Slowmo”** technique added to both the main playlist and the sound effects playlist.

Cinematic techniques automatically:
- add the necessary elements to the composition (tracks, events, etc.)  
- create connections in the editor (so you don’t have to)  
- create events or mixes that can be triggered with a single click  
- add required elements to playlists  

To use a technique, either **trigger the events** or play the **mix**. Events are activated using the **“Trigger”** button, and mixes are played just like regular tracks.

Each event and mix has a meaningful name so you can easily identify its purpose.

## Next Steps

Cinematic techniques automatically configure many elements in the editor. At any time, you can switch to the editor view to see how a technique has been constructed.

By analyzing them, you can better understand how the editor works and start creating your own techniques.  
The only limits are your imagination… and a few minor technical constraints 😉.
