## What is track trimming?

**Track trimming** means using only a selected part of a track instead of the entire file.

A trimmed track will only play the portion you’ve chosen.

**NOTE:** To split a track into multiple parts, add it several times and trim each version separately.

## How to trim a track

Trimming tracks is done from the **Editor view**. To open it, click the **Editor icon** from the side menu.

Each added track shows a waveform preview. Below it are controls for the **start** and **end** points.

You can trim a track in two ways:
- **(Desktop):** hold **Ctrl** and click the waveform with the left or right mouse button. The **left button** sets the start, and the **right button** sets the end of the track.  
- **(Desktop & Mobile):** adjust the **start** and **end** values using the numeric controls.  

In both cases, the start point must come before the end point.

The green area on the waveform indicates the trimmed section that will be played.
