## What Is Track Trimming?

**Track trimming** means using only a selected portion of a track instead of the entire file.

A trimmed track will play only the part that has been selected.

**NOTE:** To split a track into multiple different parts, duplicate it several times and trim each copy separately.

## How to Trim a Track

Track trimming is available in the **Editor view**.  

To open the editor, click the **Editor icon** in the side menu.

Each added track displays a waveform preview.  

Next to it are controls for the **start** and **end** points of the track.

You can trim a track in two ways:
- By dragging the **colored handles** on the waveform preview. The left handle sets the start, and the right handle sets the end of the track.  
- By changing the values in the **start** and **end** controls manually.  

In both cases, the start position must come before the end position.

The trimmed section is marked with a different color on the waveform preview.
