Control over track playback is usually handled from the **playlist** or the **Now Playing** view.

## Playing tracks from a playlist

Tracks in a playlist have buttons for **play**, **pause**, and **stop** — just like in most music players.

The **pause button** appears when the track is currently playing.

## Playing tracks from the “Now Playing” view

The **Now Playing** view lists all currently playing tracks.  
Each track has its own control buttons, functioning exactly like those in the playlist.

## Playing multiple tracks at once

At the top of the **Now Playing** view, there are buttons that control **all currently playing tracks**.  
They allow you to:
- resume all paused tracks  
- pause all tracks  
- stop all tracks

These buttons are useful when you want to stop everything at once without clicking each track individually.

## Track volume and speed

You can adjust a track’s **volume** and **playback speed**:
- Volume range: 0–100%  
- Speed range: 0.1–2.0× (10–200%)

The **“R” buttons** reset values to their defaults.

**NOTE:** Changing the playback speed also changes the pitch.  
To alter speed without affecting pitch, use sound effects.

## Looping a track

Looping is disabled by default.  
To loop a track, enable the **“Loop”** checkbox.

You can set the number of repetitions between **0 and 100×**.  

**NOTE:** If looping is enabled and repetitions are set to **0×**, the track will loop **indefinitely**.

## Changing position in a track

The yellow indicator shows the current playback position.  

You can manually change it by clicking anywhere on the waveform preview — the track will immediately jump to that position.

The current position and total track length are displayed below the waveform.
