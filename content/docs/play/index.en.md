Track playback is usually controlled from the **playlist view** or the **Now Playing** view.

## Playing Tracks from the Playlist

Tracks in a playlist have buttons for starting, pausing, and stopping playback.  
These buttons work the same way as in other music player applications.

The pause button appears when a track is playing.

## Playing Tracks from the “Now Playing” View

The **Now Playing** view shows all tracks currently being played.  
Each track includes the same playback controls as those found in the playlist.

## Playing Multiple Tracks at Once

At the top of the **Now Playing** view, there are buttons for controlling **all** currently playing tracks.  
They allow you to:
- resume all paused tracks  
- pause all tracks  
- stop all tracks

You can adjust a track’s **volume** and **playback speed**:
- volume ranges from **0–100%**  
- speed ranges from **0.1–2.0×** (10–200%)

The **“R”** buttons reset the values to default.

To change only the speed without altering pitch, use **sound effects**.
