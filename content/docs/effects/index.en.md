## What are sound effects?

**Sound effects** are various types of audio modifiers — from simple pitch changes to more complex simulations of room acoustics, echo, or reverb.  

The **Effect Mixer** is the component that allows you to add sound effects to tracks.  

Once you select the effects, adjust their parameters, and connect the mixer to a track, those effects will be applied during playback.

Available sound effect types:
- **Amplify** – changes the track’s volume.  
- **Echo** – adds an echo effect.  
- **Chamber Echo** – simulates the sound of a large room (*reverb*).  
- **Swirler** – creates a pulsing sound effect.  
- **Pitch Shift** – changes the track’s pitch.  
- **Old Radio** – gives the sound an old radio or walkie-talkie tone.  
- **Muffle** – softens the sound by reducing high frequencies.

## How does the Effect Mixer work?

To use the mixer, add it to the editor, choose your desired effects, set their parameters, and then connect the mixer to selected tracks.

**Effect order matters** – they are applied sequentially, one after another, meaning earlier effects influence those that follow.

- **Add Effect** – opens a menu where you can choose an effect to add to the mixer.  
- **Enabled** – turns the mixer on or off. When disabled, effects are not applied.  
- **Input (slot)** – connects the mixer to one or more tracks.  
- **Enable (input slot)** – activates the mixer.  
- **Disable (input slot)** – deactivates the mixer.
