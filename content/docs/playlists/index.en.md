Playlists are used to organize elements (tracks, events) according to the user’s needs.  

Each new composition contains at least one playlist to which elements can be added.

## Creating a new Playlist {#new-list}

To create a new playlist, click the **plus icon** located to the right of the last playlist tab.

## Duplicating

You can duplicate a playlist along with all its elements.  
To do this, click the **ellipsis icon** and choose **“Duplicate playlist”** from the dropdown menu.  
A copy of the playlist will appear with “(copy)” appended to its name.  

You can rename it afterward if you wish.

## Adding elements

Elements can be moved to a playlist from the **Composition View**.  
Select the Composition view from the side menu.

Then, to move an element from the composition to a playlist, click and drag it onto the playlist on the right side of the window.

You can also select multiple elements by clicking the **checkbox** on the left side of each element, then drag them all at once.  

Clicking the **“select / deselect all”** icon allows you to quickly select or unselect all items in the composition.

## Removing elements

To remove an element from a playlist, click the **lightning / more options icon**, then select **“Remove”** from the dropdown menu.

This will remove the element only from the current playlist.  
If the same element appears in other playlists, it will remain there.

## Changing the order of elements

Elements in a playlist can be arranged in any order.

To change the order, click the **drag handle** icon on the left side of the element, drag it to a new position, and release the mouse button.
