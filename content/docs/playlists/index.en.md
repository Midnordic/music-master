Playlists are used to categorize elements (tracks, events) according to the user’s needs.

Each new composition contains at least two playlists to which elements can be added: the **main playlist** and the **sound effects playlist**.

## Types of Playlists {#kinds}

There are two types of playlists:
- main (located in the upper part of the screen)
- sound effects (located in the lower part of the screen)

### Main Playlist

The main playlist is designed to hold tracks that should be played in a specific order.

Playback from the main playlist works similarly to other music players:
- only one track from the main playlist can play at a time
- tracks play one after another
- you can enable playlist looping (*repeat*)
- you can enable random order (*shuffle*)
- you can disable automatic transition to the next track (*auto-advance*)

To play a track from the playlist, click the **“Play”** button located to its right.

### Sound Effects Playlist

The sound effects playlist is designed for quickly triggering short sound effects.

After adding a track or event to this playlist, it appears as a button with a symbol. You can choose the symbol from a list of available icons.

Playback from this playlist works differently:
- any number of tracks can be played at the same time
- tracks are played only when their button is clicked

To play a track, simply click its corresponding button.

## Creating a New Playlist {#new-list}

To create a new playlist (of any type), click the **plus icon** located to the right of the last playlist tab.

A new playlist will be created with a default name.

## Renaming

To rename a playlist, click the **ellipsis icon** and select **“Rename playlist”** from the dropdown menu, then enter the new name.

## Deleting

To delete a playlist, click the **ellipsis icon** and select **“Delete playlist.”** The playlist will be removed.

## Duplicating

You can duplicate a playlist along with all its elements.  
To do this, click the **ellipsis icon** and select **“Duplicate playlist.”**  
A copy of the playlist will be created with “(copy)” added to its name.

You can remove this suffix by renaming the playlist.

## Adding Elements

Elements can be moved to a playlist from the **Composition** view.  
Select the Composition view from the side menu.

To move an element, click and drag it from the composition onto the playlist on the right side of the window.

You can also select multiple elements using the checkbox on the left side of each item and move them together.

Clicking the **“select / deselect all”** icon allows you to quickly select or unselect all elements in the composition.

## Removing Elements

To remove an element from a playlist, click the **lightning / more options icon**, then select **“Remove”** from the dropdown menu.

This removes the element only from the current playlist.  
If the same element exists in other playlists, it will remain there.

## Changing Element Order

Elements in a playlist can be arranged in any order.

To change the order, click the **drag handle icon** on the left side of an element, drag it to a new position, and release the mouse button.
