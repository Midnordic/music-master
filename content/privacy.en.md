## 1. Introduction

Thank you for your interest in **Music Master**, developed by **Midnordic**. We value your privacy and are committed to keeping your data safe. This Privacy Policy explains what information is collected, how it’s used, and what rights you have.

## 2. Information We Collect

**Music Master** itself does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data.

The app runs entirely on your device and operates fully offline, except when activating/validating the license, when it needs to contact our servers. However we do not store any personal data on our servers.

The only personal information associated with your purchase is your email address, which is collected by the payment provider solely for processing payments, delivering your purchase, and providing customer support.

## 3. License Verification

To protect against unauthorized use, Music Master generates a machine fingerprint derived from limited, non-personal hardware information.

This fingerprint is stored locally on your device and also saved as a hashed value in the payment processor’s database for license verification.
The hash cannot be used to identify you personally or to reconstruct your hardware details.

It is used solely to confirm the validity of your license and ensure that your copy of the app remains active.

## 4. Third-Party Services

When you purchase **Music Master**, your transaction is handled by a third-party payment processor. Please refer to their own privacy policy to understand how they handle your data.

We do not control or take responsibility for how third-party services process your data.

## 5. Cookies and Tracking

The website does not use cookies or tracking technologies.

If you visit the app’s store page, that platform may use cookies according to their own policies.

## 6. Data Sharing

We do not sell, trade, or share your personal information with anyone.

## 7. Children’s Privacy

**Music Master** is not directed toward children under 13.

We do not knowingly collect personal data from children.

## 8. Your Rights

Because we do not store any personal information ourselves, there is no user data to access, correct, or delete. For payment-related data (such as your email tied to purchase), please contact the payment provider directly.

## 9. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally to reflect legal or technical changes. Updates will always be published on this page, with the date of the last revision clearly indicated.
