## What is it?

The **creeping dread** technique is about twisting something normal into something deeply unsettling. It begins with a perfectly ordinary or even cheerful track — a love song, a calm piano tune — and slowly corrupts it.

The tempo drops, the pitch lowers, the singer’s voice stretches and warps until it sounds wrong. Add a low drone underneath, maybe a faint metallic screech or distorted whisper, and **suddenly the once-harmless melody feels sinister.**

## Movie example

In ***The Naked Gun (2025)*** snowman scene, this transformation happens right before your ears. It starts as a lighthearted, romantic winter tune — soft vocals and warm holiday vibe. But as the scene lingers, the song begins to drag. The singer’s voice deepens and bends out of key, the instruments stretch unnaturally, and strange sounds creep into the background — wind turning into a low rumble. 

Before you realize it, the cozy moment has **morphed into dread**. The music didn’t stop — it just turned against you.

## What to use it for?

As a Game Master, distorted music is a perfect tool for signaling a **sudden shift from safety to fear**. 

Imagine your players celebrating in a tavern while a cheerful folk tune plays. Without warning, you lower the tempo and pitch — the laughter slows, the singer’s voice turns monstrous, and a haunting reverb rises underneath. 

**The change tells them that something is wrong before you even describe it.**

Use this technique for:
- psychological horror
- supernatural revelation
- dreamlike dissonance

It’s especially effective when your players feel safe — that’s when the twist hits the hardest. **Because they know that melody, and now it’s betraying them.**

1. **Add two tracks**: the calm one and the other one for eerie overlay. Keep in mind that the effect is best suitable for tracks with vocals, as it distorts them in the most creepy way.
1. Open the Editor and add a **Fixed Value node**. Now connect the output with volume and speed values from the calm track. {{< figure src="figure1.jpg" link="figure1.jpg" caption="Fig. 1 - First Fixed Value node" class="blog-post-section-img" target="_blank" >}}
1. Add a **second Fixed Value node** and connect it with the eerie overlay track. {{< figure src="figure2.jpg" link="figure2.jpg" caption="Fig. 2 - Second Fixed Value Node" class="blog-post-section-img" target="_blank" >}}
1. Those two Fixed Value nodes will control the tempo and volume of the tracks. We need to **set proper values** for each node. For the **first track** let's set those values to 1.00 (starting value) and 0.75 (modified value). That means that the first track will be played at 100% volume and speed, until we change it - then it will slow down to 75%. Set transition time for both values to 5 seconds.
1. For the **second track** let's set 0.00 (starting value) and 0.30 (modified value). Connecting it to the volume means that we want to start on mute, and then increase the volume gradually. Set transition time for both values to 5 seconds.
1. All that's left is **adding events**. Add two events: one for starting the main track, and second one for transitioning into dread. Connect them to tracks (to play them) and Fixed Value nodes to switch to different values on trigger. That's it! {{< figure src="figure3.jpg" link="figure3.jpg" caption="Fig. 3 - Events" class="blog-post-section-img" target="_blank" >}}
1. Now you can move the two events to any playlist and trigger it anytime. {{< figure src="figure4.jpg" link="figure4.jpg" caption="Fig. 4 - Playlist" class="blog-post-section-img" target="_blank" >}}
