## What is it?

The **creeping dread** technique is about twisting something normal into something deeply unsettling. It begins with a perfectly ordinary or even cheerful track — a love song, a calm piano tune — and slowly corrupts it.

The tempo drops, the pitch lowers, the singer’s voice stretches and warps until it sounds wrong. Add a low drone underneath, maybe a faint metallic screech or distorted whisper, and **suddenly the once-harmless melody feels sinister.**

## Movie example

In ***The Naked Gun (2025)*** snowman scene, this transformation happens right before your ears. It starts as a lighthearted, romantic winter tune — soft vocals and warm holiday vibe. But as the scene lingers, the song begins to drag. The singer’s voice deepens and bends out of key, the instruments stretch unnaturally, and strange sounds creep into the background — wind turning into a low rumble. 

Before you realize it, the cozy moment has **morphed into dread**. The music didn’t stop — it just turned against you.

## What to use it for?

As a Game Master, distorted music is a perfect tool for signaling a **sudden shift from safety to fear**. 

Imagine your players celebrating in a tavern while a cheerful folk tune plays. Without warning, you lower the tempo and pitch — the laughter slows, the singer’s voice turns monstrous, and a haunting reverb rises underneath. 

**The change tells them that something is wrong before you even describe it.**

Use this technique for:
- psychological horror
- supernatural revelation
- dreamlike dissonance

It’s especially effective when your players feel safe — that’s when the twist hits the hardest. **Because they know that melody, and now it’s betraying them.**
