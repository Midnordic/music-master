## What is it?

Slowmo is a transformation that twists normal time into something thick and unreal, like the world is moving through syrup. It changes the rhythm of action by stretching it out until every movement feels deliberate, intense, and slightly unnatural.

## Movie example

In the first battle of **300**, slow motion is not just a visual trick, it is an audio design strategy. When the Spartans clash with the Persians, the mix alternates between real-time chaos and stretched-out, sculpted impact. The shift is immediate: the music pulls into slower, longer strokes, like someone grabbed the tempo by the throat.

Then the scene snaps back toward normal speed and the contrast does the work. The return of sharper transients and busier texture makes the battlefield feel suddenly crowded again. For a GM, that is the lesson: use Slowmo as a controlled pocket. Drop into it for a strike, a fall, a saved life, a brutal finish. Let the music stretch and the impacts bloom so the table feels the weight of the moment. Then restore time and let the rush of normal sound feel like the cost of continuing.

## What to use it for?

As a Game Master, you start in a normal, safe beat: the party has the upper hand in a clean fight, a confident plan, clear sightlines, predictable enemies. Then Slowmo arrives like a command from the universe. An arrow leaves the bow and the room stretches. Footsteps become drawn-out thuds. The players hear their own breathing louder than the battlefield. Every choice becomes a spotlight moment: step left, raise the shield, commit to the strike. The fight is still happening, but the scene is no longer about "who wins." It is about "what it costs."

Use this technique for:
- Turning a chaotic fight into a sequence of decisive, cinematic micro-moments.
- Signaling a critical hit, a near-death dodge, or a fate-changing decision.
- Making violence feel weighty by letting players hear the time between actions.
