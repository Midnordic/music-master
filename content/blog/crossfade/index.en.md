## What is it?

A crossfade is one of those subtle movie tricks you might not even notice, but it shapes how you feel a scene. It's when one piece of music slowly fades out while another fades in, keeping the transition smooth and immersive. Instead of a hard stop or sudden change, the two tracks overlap - creating a **tone shift** that feels natural and emotional.

## Movie example

A great example comes from ***The Terminator (1984)***, in the nightclub scene where the killer robot finally spots Sarah Connor. At first, the upbeat synth-pop song ***Burning in the Third Degree*** sets a casual, lively mood. But as danger creeps in, that track quietly fades while the dark, pulsing Terminator theme rises underneath. 

**Without a single line of dialogue, the tone changes - the fun club vibe turns into dread.**

## What to use it for?

As a Game Master, you can use the same trick to control tension in your sessions. Let's say your players are relaxing in a cozy tavern with cheerful background music. When you're ready to turn up the tension - maybe an assassin enters, or a secret is revealed - start fading that track out while bringing in something darker underneath. 

**The shift will hit your players subconsciously before they even realize why they feel uneasy.**

Crossfades are great for **maintaining flow**. There's no sudden jolt or awkward silence while you change the tracks - just a smooth slide from calm to chaos (or the other way around). 

Use this technique for:
- scene pacing
- transitions between scenes
- shifting emotional tone mid-dialogue

It's an invisible tool that keeps your players **immersed** and gives your session cinematic feeling.
